# Individual Model Testing

## Due to the lack of previous knowledge or understanding of outputs/inputs for each model that will be testing in the pipeline, I will be assesing each model individually with the same data that will be used in the pipeline

## The pipeline will be developed to compare and measure certian metrics in an efficient manner, so that future engineers for this project can use a different DICOM dataset if needed for personal testing purposes.
